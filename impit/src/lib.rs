//! # impit | browser impersonation made simple
//! 
//! impit is a `rust` library that allows you to impersonate a browser and make requests to websites. It is built on top of `reqwest`, `rustls` and `tokio` and supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.
//! 
//! The library provides a simple API for making requests to websites, and it also allows you to customize the request headers, use proxies, custom timeouts and more.
//! 
//! ```rust
//! use impit::impit::Impit;
//! use impit::emulation::Browser;
//!  
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!    let mut impit = Impit::builder()
//!        .with_browser(Browser::Firefox)
//!        .with_http3()
//!        .build();
//! 
//!    let response = impit.get(String::from("https://example.com"), None).await;
//! 
//!    match response {
//!        Ok(response) => {
//!            println!("{}", response.text().await.unwrap());
//!        }
//!        Err(e) => {
//!            println!("{:#?}", e);
//!        }
//!    }
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! ### Other projects
//! 
//! If you are looking for a command-line tool that allows you to make requests to websites, check out the [`impit-cli`](https://github.com/apify/impit-cli/) project.
//! 
//! If you'd prefer to use `impit` from a Node.js application, check out the [`impit-node`](https://github.com/apify/impit-node) repository, or download the package from npm:
//! ```bash
//! npm install impit
//! ```
//! 
//! ### Usage from Rust
//! 
//! Technically speaking, the `impit` project is a somewhat thin wrapper around `reqwest` that provides a more ergonomic API for making requests to websites. 
//! The real strength of `impit` is that it uses patched versions of `rustls` and other libraries that allow it to make browser-like requests.
//! 
//! Note that if you want to use this library in your rust project, you have to add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! impit = { git="https://github.com/apify/impit.git", branch="master" }
//! 
//! [patch.crates-io]
//! rustls = { git="https://github.com/apify/rustls.git", branch="impit-patch" }
//! h2 = { git="https://github.com/apify/h2.git", branch="impit-patch" }
//! ```
//! 
//! Without the patched dependencies, the project won't build.
//! 
//! Note that you also have to build your project with `rustflags = "--cfg reqwest_unstable"`, otherwise, the build will also fail.
//! This is because `impit` uses unstable features of `reqwest` (namely `http3` support), which are not available in the stable version of the library.

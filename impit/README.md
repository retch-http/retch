# impit | browser impersonation made simple

impit is a `rust` library that allows you to impersonate a browser and make requests to websites. It is built on top of `reqwest`, `rustls` and `tokio` and supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3.

The library provides a simple API for making requests to websites, and it also allows you to customize the request headers, use proxies, custom timeouts and more.

```rust
use impit::impit::Impit;
use impit::emulation::Browser;
 
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
   let mut impit = Impit::builder()
       .with_browser(Browser::Firefox)
       .with_http3()
       .build();

   let response = impit.get(String::from("https://example.com"), None).await;

   match response {
       Ok(response) => {
           println!("{}", response.text().await.unwrap());
       }
       Err(e) => {
           println!("{:#?}", e);
       }
   }
}
```

### Other projects

If you are looking for a command-line tool that allows you to make requests to websites, check out the [`impit-cli`](https://github.com/apify/impit-cli/) project.

If you'd prefer to use `impit` from a Node.js application, check out the [`impit-node`](https://github.com/apify/impit-node) repository, or download the package from npm:
```bash
npm install impit
```

### Usage from Rust

Technically speaking, the `impit` project is a somewhat thin wrapper around `reqwest` that provides a more ergonomic API for making requests to websites. 
The real strength of `impit` is that it uses patched versions of `rustls` and other libraries that allow it to make browser-like requests.

Note that if you want to use this library in your rust project, you have to add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
impit = { git="https://github.com/apify/impit.git", branch="master" }

[patch.crates-io]
rustls = { git="https://github.com/apify/rustls.git", branch="impit-patch" }
h2 = { git="https://github.com/apify/h2.git", branch="impit-patch" }
```

Without the patched dependencies, the project won't build.

Note that you also have to build your project with `rustflags = "--cfg reqwest_unstable"`, otherwise, the build will also fail.
This is because `impit` uses unstable features of `reqwest` (namely `http3` support), which are not available in the stable version of the library.
